# Ryo — TODO to production

> *Status at a glance:* code for the v1 guest flow has landed (M0–M6), three dashboards exist (`/`, `/account`, `/host`, `/admin`), the site styles correctly, dummy data renders out-of-the-box, and the repo is on GitHub. **What's left is everything around the code: live backend, domain, email, legal, observability, and the few remaining code blockers.**

**Legend** · 🔴 blocker for any user-facing launch · 🟡 needed before public launch (closed-beta-ok without) · 🟢 polish · ⏳ external dependency (someone outside engineering has to act)

## You (founder) — do these in parallel with my engineering work

The fastest path is for these to happen in the background while I build:

- [ ] ⏳🔴 **Register domains** — `ryostays.com` (primary) + `ryo.stay` (product) + `ryo.co.in` (India market). Cloudflare or Namecheap. ~30 min, then ~24h DNS propagation.
- [ ] ⏳🔴 **Create a Supabase project** at supabase.com (free tier is fine for v1). Choose Mumbai (`ap-south-1`) for India launch. Once created, grab the **Project URL** and **anon public key** and paste them to me; I'll wire them in.
- [ ] ⏳🔴 **Open an Apple Developer account** — $99/year, 24–48h verification. Needed to ship iOS app.
- [ ] ⏳🔴 **Open a Google Play Console account** — $25 one-time, ~1 day verification.
- [ ] ⏳🟡 **Pick a transactional-email provider** — recommendation: **Resend** (~$0–20/mo at v1 volumes). Alternative: AWS SES. Reply with the choice and I'll set it up against `mail.ryostays.com`.
- [ ] ⏳🟡 **Subscribe to Iubenda or Termly** for auto-generated Terms / Privacy / Cookie policy (~$60–100/year). I'll wire the pages in once you confirm which.
- [ ] ⏳🟡 **Logo + wordmark** — once we have a real logo, the `bnb → Ryo` rename PR can land (it's currently blocked on this).
- [ ] ⏳🟡 **Revoke leaked GitHub tokens** at https://github.com/settings/tokens (4 of them, see chat). Make one new classic PAT with `repo` + `workflow` + `read:org` if you want clean future `gh` flows.

## Code / engineering — what I'll build

Ordered by dependency. Each is a PR-sized chunk with a verification step. ETAs assume one developer.

### M8 — Live Supabase + first preview deploy 🔴 (1 day)

- [ ] Provision Supabase project (staging + production)
- [ ] Apply `supabase/migrations/0001_init.sql` to both
- [ ] Seed staging with `supabase/seed.sql`
- [ ] Add Storage buckets (`listing_photos`, `avatars`) with RLS
- [ ] Wire env vars: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` + `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` in Vercel (web) and EAS profiles (mobile)
- [ ] First Vercel preview deploy on a temporary `*.vercel.app` URL
- [ ] Magic-link sign-in delivers real email (Supabase's default sender is fine for now)

**Unblocks:** every visible-to-user verification, real auth, real bookings, M9+.

### M9 — Production-blocking bugs 🔴 (2 days)

- [ ] **9.1** Booking double-booking fix — new migration `0002_booking_locks.sql` adding `daterange` exclusion via `btree_gist`; wrap booking create in a transaction. Two concurrent bookings of the same dates → exactly one wins.
- [ ] **9.2** Error UX layer — `Toast` + `ErrorBoundary` primitives in `@bnb/ui`; wrap web + mobile shells; replace every `console.warn` in auth + booking with a real surfaced error.
- [ ] **9.3** Hard-fail dummy fallback when `NODE_ENV === 'production'`. Keep dummy in dev (it's what makes the demo work without Supabase).

**Unblocks:** safe-enough to expose to real users.

### M10 — Domain + transactional email + legal pages 🔴 (4–5 days)

- [ ] Configure DNS: web → Vercel; mail → Resend (or SES)
- [ ] SPF / DKIM / DMARC on `mail.ryostays.com`
- [ ] Minimum React Email templates: magic-link, booking-confirmed, booking-cancelled, receipt
- [ ] Wire `apps/web/app/api/booking/confirm/route.ts` server route to send the confirmation
- [ ] Set up `support@ryostays.com` inbound (shared inbox)
- [ ] Legal pages: `apps/web/app/legal/{terms,privacy,cookies}/page.tsx` + footer links + cookie-consent banner

**Unblocks:** legally shippable; users get real email; M15 mobile (App Store needs Privacy URL).

### M11 — Observability + security hardening 🟡 (2 days)

- [ ] Sentry (`@sentry/nextjs` + `sentry-expo`)
- [ ] PostHog for product analytics (signup, search, listing-view, booking-start, booking-confirm)
- [ ] Security headers in `apps/web/middleware.ts` (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy)
- [ ] Rate limit on booking-confirm (Upstash Redis)
- [ ] DOMPurify on listing description / review body when rich text lands
- [ ] ESLint rule forbidding `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE` import in client bundles

### M12 — Rebrand `bnb → ryo` 🟡 (1 day, gated on logo) ⏳

- [ ] Package names `@bnb/*` → `@ryo/*`
- [ ] Root `package.json` name
- [ ] Expo `app.json` slug, scheme, bundle IDs (`com.ryo.app`)
- [ ] Deep-link scheme `bnb://` → `ryo://`
- [ ] README, page titles, branding strings
- [ ] Folder rename `/bnb` → `/ryo` (last step)

### M13 — i18n + accessibility + SEO 🟡 (5 days)

- [ ] `next-intl` (web) + `expo-localization` (mobile)
- [ ] Locale catalogues `packages/config/i18n/{en-IN,en-US,hi-IN}.json`
- [ ] Extract every UI string from `packages/features/src/**/*.tsx` to ICU keys
- [ ] Locale picker in footer; RTL plumbing ready
- [ ] `accessibilityLabel` on every interactive component; alt text on listing photos; 44 px tap targets; axe-core CI check
- [ ] Per-route `generateMetadata` (dynamic for listings); `robots.txt`; dynamic `sitemap.ts`; OG image generation via `next/og`

### M14 — CI/CD + automated tests 🟡 (3–4 days)

- [ ] GitHub Actions: install → lint → typecheck → next build → Playwright e2e
- [ ] Vercel auto-deploy: preview on PR, production on main
- [ ] Vitest + React Testing Library: unit tests for `@bnb/api` + `@bnb/utils` (≥60% line coverage)
- [ ] One Playwright happy-path e2e: sign-in → search → listing → book → trips
- [ ] Lighthouse CI thresholds (85 perf / 95 a11y / 95 SEO / 95 best-practices)

### M15 — Mobile app store readiness 🔴 (5 engineering days + ~2 weeks store review) ⏳

- [ ] EAS `eas.json` with `preview` + `production` profiles
- [ ] App icons + splash screens generated from the locked brand source
- [ ] iOS provisioning + Android keystore set up
- [ ] Store listings: description, screenshots, video, age rating
- [ ] Privacy nutrition labels (Apple) + Play Store policy
- [ ] TestFlight + Play Internal-Test track → external testers → production submit

### M16 — Trust / Safety / Support minimum 🟡 (2 days)

- [ ] `report a listing` and `report a review` API endpoints → email to `support@ryostays.com`
- [ ] `audit_log` table populated from concierge-grade actions
- [ ] Published SLA: chat <2 min / email <30 min
- [ ] One-page incident runbook for founder + first concierge hire

### M17 — Performance + image pipeline 🟢 (2 days)

- [ ] Replace direct Unsplash links with Supabase Storage (origin) + `next/image` (CDN)
- [ ] `packages/ui/src/Image.tsx` becomes a smart cross-platform wrapper
- [ ] Bundle analyser run; code-split `HomeScreen` / `ListingScreen`
- [ ] Lighthouse Performance ≥ 90 across `/`, `/search`, `/listing/[id]`

### M18 — Launch checklist 🔴 (3 days)

- [ ] `security.txt` at `/.well-known/security.txt`
- [ ] DPO + abuse contact emails published
- [ ] Status page (Better Stack)
- [ ] DR doc: Supabase daily backup, restore procedure, RPO/RTO
- [ ] Day-1 runbook (where to look in Sentry, how to comp a refund, how to escalate)
- [ ] **Remove or feature-flag** `/host` and `/admin` v2-preview routes — synthetic data must not ship to public

---

## Code-level items NOT on the milestone path (smaller, can land anytime)

- [ ] Google OAuth button on `SignInScreen` (`signInWithOAuth` is wired in api but UI missing)
- [ ] Profile edit mode (currently read-only — name / avatar / locale / currency setters)
- [ ] Phone verification flow (schema fields exist, no UI)
- [ ] Booking cancellation button on `/trips` (status enum supports it, no UI)
- [ ] Listing share button (icon present, no `onPress`)
- [ ] Sort controls on search (API supports `.order()`, UI doesn't expose)
- [ ] Destination autocomplete (plain text input today)
- [ ] Review submission flow (read-only display today; needs verified-stay gate)
- [ ] Booking detail screen at `/trips/[id]`

| M12 — Rebrand | 1 |
| M13 — i18n + a11y + SEO | 5 |
| M14 — CI/CD + tests | 4 |
| M15 — Mobile app store (eng portion) | 5 |
| M16 — T&S / support minimum | 2 |
| M17 — Performance + images | 2 |
| M18 — Launch checklist | 3 |
| **Total** | **~32 engineering days** |

**Critical-path calendar time:** ~9 weeks including external-dependency waits (Apple/Google review ~2 weeks, DNS, legal review).

With one developer: ~7 calendar weeks at a steady pace.
With two: ~4–5 calendar weeks.

## What I can start right now (no external dependency)

While you handle the ⏳ items above, I can land:

1. **M9** (2 days) — booking race-condition fix + error UX + production dummy hard-fail
2. **Small code items** above — Google OAuth UI, profile edit, booking cancel, share button, sort controls (~1 day each)
3. **M11 partial** — security headers + ESLint guard (Sentry / PostHog need accounts you create)

Tell me which to pick up first.
